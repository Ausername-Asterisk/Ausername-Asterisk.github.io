# Data Touches Everything
## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my academic journey and a platform for organizing my knowledge and goals in AI and Data Science as I pursue my Data Analystic and Data Science master's degree at Georgia Tech, guided by the [Artificial Intelligence Roadmap](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#note). With a strong foundation in essential components that underlie modern data science methodologies, key areas include:

- **Optimization:** Fundamental techniques crucial for developing machine learning algorithms, sample code implemented using Python.
  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Focus on algorithms suited for handling large datasets with low-dimensional features, encompassing foundational tasks such as regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Advanced ensemble methods like boosting and bagging are also explored for enhanced model performance.
  
- **High-Dimensional Data Analysis:** Specialized methods for extracting informative features from datasets characterized by high dimensionality and limited samples. This includes advanced techniques in image processing, tensor analysis, and regularization.
  
- **Deep Learning:** Advanced modeling techniques designed for large-scale datasets and complex feature sets. Upcoming studies in Fall 2024 will focus on neural networks, gradient descent optimization, and advanced architectures such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks using PyTorch.

## Optimization Course at Georgia Tech
This graduate-level optimization course covered essential concepts, models, and algorithms in depth. Beginning with foundational principles and mathematical underpinnings, the curriculum progressed through linear optimization techniques, including advanced topics such as the simplex method and duality theory. Subsequent modules explored nonlinear and convex conic optimization, broadening understanding beyond linear models. Additionally, the course included a study of integer optimization, providing insights into integrating integer decision variables into optimization frameworks.

Practical skills were developed in formulating and solving complex optimization problems using Python-based tools. This experience enhanced proficiency in optimization theory, computational methods, and their applications in modern data analytics.
