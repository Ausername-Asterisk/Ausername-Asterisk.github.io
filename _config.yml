          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            This graduate-level optimization course covered essential concepts, models, and algorithms in depth. Beginning with foundational principles and mathematical underpinnings, the curriculum progressed through linear optimization techniques, including advanced topics such as the simplex method and duality theory. Subsequent modules explored nonlinear and convex conic optimization, broadening understanding beyond linear models. Additionally, the course included a study of integer optimization, providing insights into integrating integer decision variables into optimization frameworks.

Practical skills were developed in formulating and solving complex optimization problems using Python-based tools. This experience enhanced proficiency in optimization theory, computational methods, and their applications in modern data analytics.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
